Run through the [quick start](/quickstart/), then start following the links below 
that will guide you though important concepts in the theme, or jump right in 
to concepts that interest you using the links to the right.

Near-term development goals are listed below, so you know what's on the horizon as 
you experience the theme. Any feedback or ideas are appreciated in our [Discord](https://discord.gg/ETx8S8cWwH).

<h2 id="roadmap">Near-Term Roadmap: (`0.0.2 - 0.0.4`)</h2>
 - More robust archetype scripts and CMS integration.
 - Docs supports sub-folders, but only one level deep. Needs a sidebar format so 
   larger installs can bypass auto-nav and hand it an object instead.
 - Blogs should be able to have per-instance archive and tag pages, with control
   over layouts used for each one.
 - Have a default localization plugin / setup.
 - More content-building components (tabs, responsive YT player helper, docs index
   page generator) Perhaps a selective generator for Discord Q&A as the start of a 
   FAQ component.
 - Have author bios and tag info content for tag and author pages so they're
   indexed better (already started)

<h2 id="contributing">Contributing</h2>

also open an issue on Github for anything from reporting a bug to proposing
a new idea. If you prefer to communicate via email, I'm `tinkertim@gmail.com`.
