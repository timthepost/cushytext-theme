# {title}
  
First, even if you're not going to use the blog feature very much, please
take a look at [how the blog system works in Cushy Text](/docs/blog-system/).

A _considerable_ amount of the concepts are the same, because `docs/` is 
a very trimmed-down version of the blog system, with the addition of having
a different kind of auto-generated navigation and the built-in content rating
system enabled by default. 
  
## Docs Data File Configuration:

Just like in [the blog system](/docs/blog-system/), docs is multi-instance and
controlled by settings in the `_data.yml` file. Looking at the one that powers
this instance:

```yml
layout: layouts/docs.vto
waypoint: "%theme-docs%"
type: docs
menu:
  visible: true
  order: 0
docs:
  basedir: /docs/
  title: "Cushy Theme Docs"
  sidebar: auto
  guest:
    heading: "Latest Blog Post:"
    waypoint: "%blog%"
    posts: 1
```

Note that I have the inclusion of a **menu** property here, which has its 
own **visibility** and **order** properties. This controls if the file will
be rendered in the side nav (both the full-size and hamburger), and 
what order it should appear if so.

Sort orders can be any signed integer. -10 will always be on top if your 
default value is 0, unless you change the template files. Which you can
totally do.

We have a **sidebar** property that right now, only supports `auto`, but 
will eventually support a custom object of some kind. 

There's also a **guest** property, which tells the sidebar navigation to 
pull in a post from the blog (not shown on small screens to save room)

## Docs Differences From Blog Posts:

There are some differences that you should be aware of:

 1. Docs let you set the `<h1>` tag. Blogs set this automatically. 

 2. Docs has auto-pagination with progress at the bottom of every 
    page, matching the order of the nav. Blogs have this, but 
    it's _only_ controlled by date, there's no `order` to sort by
    with blogs.
  
 3. Docs do not display tags. They could, if you wanted them to, but 
    I didn't see a need for them. You can of course _apply_ them and 
    use them for searches and queries, but no pages are generated
    for them and they aren't otherwise really used in docs.

## Docs RSS / JSON Feed Configuration:

Right now, `/docs` comes manually set-up wih the theme so you have the 
documentation right there when developing and customizing it. The feed
is set up in `plugins.ts` where the rest of the feeds are created. 

## Docs Feature Roadmap In The Theme:

The current navigation generation does ***not*** deal with nested
directories very well at all. My goal for "good enough to ship" 
was "good enough to document this theme with" and we've far surpassed
that, but it needs more work.

Right now it just uses a simple search with a waypoint to build the 
nav, which isn't sufficient to handle a tree. I plan to change this over
to use the nav plugin (`nav.menu.children()`), but it's a fair amount of 
work and not for the first release. Not only the side nav, but also the 
responsive fly-out nav.

Maybe by the third release, `docs` will be flexible enough for large 
projects too.
