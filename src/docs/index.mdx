# Current Status: <span class="text--success">Launching Soon!</span>

Things are pretty stable, it's time to cut a release people can update from. It's also time
for this repo to just be for `cushytext.deno.dev` and release the theme from a brand new 
repo of its own!

  message="***I still expect the first testing release (`0.0.1-rc1`) to be ready around the first week of April, 2025. Here's a [release plan](https://github.com/timthepost/cushytext/blob/main/RELEASE-TODO.md) (Github Link) for the release, and how the transition away from this current repo will work.***"

You're still welcome to [clone the development repo that also hosts 
this website](https://github.com/timthepost/cushytext), but understand 
that you're getting a whole copy of this site, and development is moving 
to an entirely new repository on release.

It's important, as it allows me do my own thing on top of the base
template, and sets me up to be downstream from my own changes, which 
is imperative as it means they'll affect me just like they affect 
everyone else downstream.

<h2 id="current_focus">Current Focus (All must be done before `0.0.1` testing release)</h2>
 - Everything needed to be a remote theme (`mod.ts` for remote files, 
   `init.ts` to generate default content) (see release plan link above)
   Other than testing and bug fixes, this is the only Cushy Text work happening 
   right now.

<h2 id="roadmap">Near-Term Roadmap: (`0.0.2 - 0.0.3`)</h2>
 - Re-doing the docs auto nav with the [Nav plugin](https://lume.land/plugins/nav/), 
   which I think also helps solve the nested sections and custom sidebar import 
   complications (though custom would have to follow the nav plugin output format).
   **Docs currently does not handle nested directories very well with the way it 
   generates navigation (or headings, in general)**.
 - More robust archetype scripts and CMS integration.
 - Blogs should be able to have per-instance archive and tag pages, with control
   over layouts used for each one.
 - Have a default localization plugin / setup.
 - More content-building components (tabs, responsive YT player helper, docs index
   page generator) Perhaps a selective generator for Discord Q&A as the start of a 
   FAQ component.
 - Have author bios and tag info content for tag and author pages so they're
   indexed better (already started)

<h2 id="contributing">Contributing</h2>

I've set up a [low-volume Discord server](https://discord.gg/ETx8S8cWwH) to coordinate efforts. You can
also open an issue on Github for anything from reporting a bug to proposing
a new idea. If you prefer to communicate via email, I'm `tinkertim@gmail.com`.

Please ***expect frequent breaking changes***. I don't knowingly push bugs 
live, but it does happen - if it's still broken in a few days please open an 
issue.

Standard [contributing guidelines](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/2/1/code_of_conduct/) apply.
