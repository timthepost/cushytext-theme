# CushyText Is A Multi-Purpose Interactive Theme For Lume 3+

Built on top of [Infima CSS][1], Cushy Text is made for text-heavy
sites that need a little bit of interactivity. 

By default, Cushy Text includes 

 - A full-featured blog, complete with tag wiki and individual tag feeds, 
 - A mini-documentation system with auto-navigation and progress links
 - Search configured out of the box via Pagefind
 - An interactive content-rating system to capture anonymous feedback on your 
   posts
 - Turn-key almost no config deploy on Deno Deploy

## Currently In Alpha Testing

This repo is public, and you're welcome to poke around, but it relies on 
a bleeding-edge version of Lume that needs nightly updates. Additionally, 
while I don't think there will be any breaking changes, there are still
some that could conceivably happen as testing continues.

Have a look at [the main site blog](https://cushytext.deno.dev/blog/) for
more updates!
